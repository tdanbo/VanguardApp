During desperate moments of the War, the battle mages of Ordo Magica took increasingly greater risks in the name of necessity and thereby brought Corruption upon themselves. To counteract this evil they dusted off an ancient and shunned ritual, by which one can capture the soul of a dying creature in a crystal prepared for the purpose. That same ritual proved to work well in order to drain Corruption from a wizard and transfer it to the soul in the stone. The ritual binds the Mystic to the crystal, which then works as an extension of the wizard's soul. The ritual allows the Mystic to move 1D4 of permanent Corruption to the soul stone with a successful Resolute test. The stone can hold up to half of the Mystic's Resolute in Corruption; it darkens as it fills up and detonates if said limit is surpassed. The collected Corruption then rushes back to the Mystic, often with a rather nasty result. In the unlikely case that he or she survives that wave of Corruption, it is possible for the Mystic to bind itself to a new soul stone and start over. The ritual costs one (1) point of Experience to perform, whether it is successful or not. A wizard that manages to learn the ritual receives a soul stone from its order chapter; other Mystics must pay their own way. To buy a soul stone costs 100 thaler.",

    "tradition": "Demonologist",
    "description": "Outside the world known to Ambrians and barbarians, winds gust over a dead, mist-covered landscape. Abominations roam the mists, hunting for life to consume. Demonologists know how to summon daemons to the world of the living, and can force them into service. These daemons come in three different forms and the summoning of each requires the use of a separate ritual, but since the procedures share many characteristics they are described together. Irrespective of the type of daemon to be summoned, the procedure is the same: the creature must appear within a symbol prepared on the ground, and wise demonologists make sure to learn, and use, the ritual Magic Circle in order to protect themselves if something goes wrong during the summoning. Summoning a daemon requires no test to be rolled once the special symbol has been created; however, in order to subdue the daemon and make it obey the demonologist, a test against [Resolute &lt; Resolute] must be passed. A blood sacrifice in the form of a living Cultural Being gives the mystic a second chance to pass the test, and if the victim has no permanent corruption the mystic also gains a +1 bonus on the test. If the test is successful, the daemon does the mystic a service; if the test fails, the daemon is free to do whatever it wishes until the same time next day. The creature cannot stay longer than that unless it is bound to the service of the demonologist. Whether or not the daemon is bound to the mystic, it can never enter magic circles, witch circles or a site protected by Sanctum. The demonologist may only bind one daemon at a time; if more are summoned, the one already bound is freed and will remain in the world for twenty-four hours before returning to its place of origin. However, if the mystic knows more than one of the summoning rituals, he or she can have one daemon of each type in service. The three rituals let the mystic summon a specific type of daemon - either a Vindictive, a Knowledgeable or a Guardian daemon. The ritual costs one point in Experience to perform, whether the test to control the daemon is a success or a failure. Vindictive Daemon: The abomination is one of the winged creatures that soar through the mists of the Yonderworld. If ordered by the mystic, the Vindictive Daemon can track down and attack a known and named creature with the intention of killing it. The mystic needs a link to the target, for example its hair, blood or an item he or she holds dear. The daemon follows the astral link to the victim; if the distance can be counted in day's marches, the daemon flies at death march pace and must test to see if something catastrophic takes place - maybe it is tracked down by witch hunters, or killed by some other monstrosity along the way. Knowledgeable Daemon: The abomination is one of the manipulative creatures lurking in the mists of the Yonderworld, always looking for lifeforms to tame and consume. A Knowledgeable Daemon answers one question from the mystic; further [Resolute &lt; Resolute] tests provide more answers. The daemon can answer yes or no on a direct question (like the ritual Fortune Telling) or answer an open question (like the ritual Oracle). Additional questions do not increase the risk of the daemon breaking free - if a test fails, the daemon will simply refuse to answer more questions - and it takes one hour to get each answer. A blood sacrifice also helps when rolling for additional questions.Guardian Daemon: The abomination is summoned from among the howling monstrosities that rage through the Yonderworld hunting for targets for their hate and frustration.The Guardian Daemon guards a place until it is killed or set free by the demonologist. The daemon will obey instructions regarding who is allowed entry or passage; the demonologist may change the definition regarding who or what may enter or pass, but the pact does not allow him or her to change the location.",

    "description": "All physical traces of the mystic and his or her allies disappear. For instance, footsteps in mud subside, broken branches and grass stalks heal and spider webs are mystically restored. The ritual works just as well in civilization; dust settles on mosaic floors and piles of paper are arranged as they were before the mystic or some ally browsed them. The duration is 24 hours, either forward or back from the casting of the ritual; traces from the previous day's activities can be obliterated, or the effect can affect all activities performed during the day after the ritual is performed. In any case, the effect of the ritual is that neither the mystic nor his or her allies can be traced by any physical means, including smell. Mystical tracking methods are not affected.",

The ritual takes one hour to perform and the effect remains active for half a day; after that the local weather returns to its natural form.",

    "description": "The Mystic breathes new life into a beautiful location and turns it into a witch circle. Witch circles are protected from prying eyes and influences from outside, and the Mystic has more or less complete control over what happens within the circle. The Mystic decides how things grow and which season it is within, and can with the Quick Growth ritual create an environment to mirror its heart's delight. It is hard to find a Witch Circle, even if you know where to look for it. It requires a [Vigilant &lt; Discreet] test to even see the circle if encountered in the wilderness. Creatures that do not see the circle will simply walk around it, without knowing they have taken a short detour. A Mystic with both the Witch Circle ritual and the Alchemy ability can make an extra attempt at Alchemy tests when using the ability inside its circle. A Mystic with Quick Growth, Witch Circle and Alchemy can make two extra attempts when using Alchemy. A Mystic who performs Borrow Beast and lets its body rest inside a Witch Circle has no limitation as to how long it can maintain the trance, since its body gets all the nutrition it needs from the ground inside the circle.",
