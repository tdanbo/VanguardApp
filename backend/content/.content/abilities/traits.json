        "description": "The creature is bound to the world in an intimate way, as if originating from the bones of the world and still being part of its foundation. It has no soul and suffers damage instead of corruption; temporary corruption causes bleeding wounds on its body. Permanent corruption instead causes a permanent reduction to the basis for calculating the creatures Pain Threshold. In practice, this means that the Pain Threshold is reduced by 1 for every other point the creature suffers in permanent corruption. Its Toughness is not affected. If the Pain Threshold is reduced to zero, the creature dies of internal bleeding and failing organs. Once dead, the creature cannot become undead and it cannot be contacted with the ritual Necromancy. The corpse decays and reunites with the slop and dust of creation, without leaving any kind of spiritual trace behind.",

The character can live up to two or even three centuries if its life is not shortened by violence, poison or disease. The creature's long lifespan makes it prone to do things at a slow pace, but this is compensated by the attitude that what is worth doing is worth doing well, which over time results in a considerable degree of expertise. Long-lived has no effect besides what it implies in terms of playing the role.",
